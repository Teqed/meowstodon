# Changelog

All changes to Catstodon that aren't Mastodon or glitch-soc Mastodon changes will be documented here.

All release dates, as well as most other dates, are intended to be read as "within the day, in UTC time."

## [Unreleased] - Unreleased

- Upstream changes
- Bump Ruby version to 3.3.5

## [4.3.0-beta.1+cat.1.0.0] - 2024-08-26

- Upstream (glitch-soc) changes
- Shorter versioning scheme (drops "glitch" in version)
  - It is obvious this code is still, and will for the foreseeable future, be based on glitch-soc.
- Release model changes
  - Glitch-soc is trying out releases. We will, similarly, do releases as well.
  - This means the main branch will now contain "nightly, but stable enough" states, similar to glitch-soc's main
    branch, but not every wave of commits to main will be accompanied by a new version.
  - Each glitch-soc release will be accompanied by a Catstodon release eventually.
  - Releases are now made whenever glitch-soc does one, or when important bugs are fixed either upstream or in
    Catstodon.
