# Meowstodon

## Introduction

This Mastodon fork is based on the [glitch-soc Fork of Mastodon](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon), with changes
made to suit [CatCatNya~](https://catcatnya.com).
I intend to contribute some useful differences back to [glitch-soc](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon)
and [vanilla Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon).

To install, take a look at [glitch-soc.github.io/docs/](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/). The instructions and
features are the same, except for the differences outlined below.

Contributing guidelines are available [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note: Use the main branch only for forks. `develop` branch may, at times,
be force-pushed to (mostly for undoing cherry-picking of vanilla commits when upstream adopts them).
I highly suggest only ever running the `main` branch in production, as is done for [CatCatNya~](https://catcatnya.com)!
I also highly suggest not rebasing on this if you are maintaining a fork,
instead, use merge (fast-forward, if possible, with merge commit otherwise).

## Differences

- Some files are adjusted specifically for the CatCatNya~ instance. Specifically, these:
  - sounds/boop.mp3
  - sounds/boop.ogg
    <br>You might want to revert these to the upstream files (or your own versions!) if you decide to use this fork for
    your own instance.
- The rate limits for authenticated users have been relaxed a bit.
- The API endpoint `/api/v1/custom_emojis` is no longer affected by AUTHORIZED_FETCH, allowing anyone to copy custom
  emojis.
- Allow higher resolution images. (4096x4096 instead of the previous limit of 3840x2160)
- Allow posting polls with only one poll option (if `MIN_POLL_OPTIONS` is set to 1 on your instance).
- Emoji reactions on statuses (with both Unicode and custom emojis, same as for announcements), a feature originally
  developed for [Nyastodon](https://git.bsd.gay/fef/nyastodon).
  Ended up as a Catstodon-maintained patch after its initial two Pull Requests to glitch-soc, but was handed over
  to [Essem's fork, Chuckya](https://github.com/TheEssem/mastodon) and is now
  pending [its fourth attempt of merging into glitch-soc](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/pull/2462).
- Lifts the "only federate local favourites" restriction on favourites/likes and emoji reactions.
- Cherry-picks the
  [activity filter branch](https://github.com/chikorita157/mastodon-sakura/tree/newmain-tmp3-noellabo-filtering)
  from [Sakurajima Mastodon](https://github.com/chikorita157/mastodon-sakura).
- Adds the ability to disable the suspicious sign in detection entirely.
  - Useful for situations where the instance may not have up-to-date IP information, such as when the period of IP
    address retention is set to a low value (see _Previous differences now merged into vanilla Mastodon_)
- Environment variable `MASTODON_USE_LIBVIPS` is true by default.
  - This is a minor change, but it _requires_ all systems running Catstodon to run a recent libvips version (8.13+).
  - Vanilla Mastodon intends to deprecate ImageMagick anyway, so sooner or later, this change will cease being one.
- Allow dashes in emoji shortcodes
  - This is simply to allow custom emoji compat with other fedi software.
  - Original patch by hazycora: https://github.com/TheEssem/mastodon/commit/2dde7a25a47a23f827e2fd2d07f55438f9985181
